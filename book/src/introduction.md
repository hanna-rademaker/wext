# Introduction
This book covers `wext`, a Rust library designed to simplify the use of DOM and web APIs alongside standard Rust. If you're building a web application in Rust, `wext` streamlines the creation and manipulation of DOM elements, as well as the implementation of event listeners and callbacks.

Note that `wext` is not a framework but a collection of helper tools. While it doesn't include a web component library, it integrates easily with libraries like `shoelace`.
